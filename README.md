// Blossom Scene - Code Review ðŸŒ¸

/*
  This scene is a spring-inspired animation with pixel-art elements and smooth CSS animations. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

  - **Sky & Clouds**: Soft pastel sky with three clouds drifting across the screen. Clouds use `drift-cloud` animation for smooth movement.
  - **Birds**: Flying birds with animated wings and varied flight paths (zigzag, curves, V-formation). Each bird has a slight delay for a natural feel.
  - **Flowers**: 24 flowers with varying sizes and colors, swaying gently to simulate wind. Positioned randomly to add life.
  - **Falling Petals**: Randomly placed petals falling naturally from the top, with rotation and sway. They accumulate at the bottom to simulate a real petal shower.
  - **Sparkles**: Small, glowing sparkles floating around, adding a magical touch.
  - **Footer**: A simple message at the bottom credits the creator.

  This project uses HAML for structure and SCSS for styling. Itâ€™s designed to feel calming, like a gentle spring day, with smooth animations and natural movement.

  Future improvements sould include interactive features and additional layers for more depth.
