  Spring Blossom Symphony - My entry for the CodePen competition!

  This project is my attempt at pushing pure CSS animation as far as I can.
  It's all built with HAML and SCSS, with a heavy focus on creating a living, breathing scene without a single line of JavaScript for the animation itself.

  Key Features I'm proud of:
  - A multi-layered parallax system built with 3D transforms.
  - Procedurally generated flight paths for the birds and falling petals using SASS loops, so it never looks quite the same.
  - A fully responsive design that adapts from ultra-wide displays down to mobile (where it hides the non-essentials).
  - Lots of little details, like the sun rays, fluffy clouds, and hover effects to make it feel alive.

  Fingers crossed this has what it takes to win the competition. I put a lot of work into getting the feeling just right!
